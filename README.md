This is an example on how to capture Worksheet events through an Excel VBA Add-Ins (xlam file).

Introduction:
=============
Outside add-ins, it is usually quite easy to catch worksheet events in a VBA Macro. The IDE provides enough support and you donâ€™t have to know so much fact about the events.
Unfortunately, it is not so easy when you create and use an Add-Ins. The code is executed in a different way, and it becomes more difficult to catch the worksheet events.
The example presents a way to catch the events on a worksheet. Following the state of the new selection, a customized toggle button will be activated or not. So, thanks this example you will know how to catch events in a worksheet through Add-Ins, but also know how to add new buttons in the Ribbon and how to deal with them.

External tools:
===============
To add new buttons in the Ribbon, you need to modify the XML file of your Add-ins (Excel files format is built around a zipped XML file). To do this, you can use Office Ribbon X Editor (available from https://github.com/fernandreu/office-ribbonx-editor) but other similar tools exist.
This tool will allow you to modify the XML content and loads image inside your Add-Ins (useful to customize the icons). It also provides a way to generate Callback functions (functions called when an action occurs on a button).
